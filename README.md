## Data Description

The `e_tibet_GY_Gongrigabu_AFT/detrital_ui` folder contains the data used for plotting and analysis in Borgohain et al. (2025). It includes six text files for visualizing posterior exhumation paths, AFT cumulative density functions, and Kolmogorov–Smirnov diagnostics.  

The `Table_e1_e2_abr1_AFT_ZFT-merged.csv` file provides simulated erosion history parameters for multiple river catchments, including pre- and post-change erosion rates, age of erosion rate change, associated errors, and sample identifiers. The `kind` column distinguishes between AFT (Apatite Fission Track) and ZFT (Zircon Fission Track) data. These datasets enable reproducible analysis of erosion and exhumation histories.
